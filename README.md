## Description
This is a utility for FiveM that allows the live editing of vehicle handling and some basic performance statistic tracking for top speed, acceleration, and deceleration.

## Installation
Just start the resource `vehicleDebug` and you're set!

## Editor
Press Left Alt while in a vehicle to bring up the menu, or change the key under the FiveM keybind settings. Click the input boxes for whichever value you would like to modify, and change it. That's it! The handling will immediately update as you type.

You can save the handling by clicking "Copy Handling" near the top. You will need to paste that over the handling file for the vehicle. Make sure you're replacing everything from **mass** to **monetary value**, nothing more, and nothing less.

## Statistics
In the top-middle of the screen, there are numbers to represent some "tops" for the vehicle. Falling or crashing will lead to irrelevant values. Reset the values within the editor by clicking "Reset Stats."
* Top speed - The fastest speed, in miles per hour, that the vehicle has reached.
* Top acceleration - An arbitrary value to represent how quickly the vehicle has accelerated.
* Top deceleration - An arbitrary value to represent how quickly the vehicle has decelerated.
